The idea behind my design was to use food dye to make a background that <br>
looked like neurons in the brain with the use of shaving cream and food dye, <br>
I produced 20 different designs with different colours including blue, red, <br>
yellow and green this created a unique range of designs when the colours <br>
mixed by using only 2 or all 4 in my backgrounds. 
<br><br>
I then scanned each image into the computer and chose my favourite 3 that <br>
stood out the most, after photo shopping the chosen 3 I placed the 'Love and <br>
Information' text on top of the backgrounds to see which text and background <br>
worked the best. The orange and blue looked the most appealing and with the <br>
white spaces within the background worked well with the text. I then made<br> 
different posters with the text in different spaces, colours and sizes, <br>
finding one I liked best.
