<h3>ABOUT ME </h3>
<h1>
Hi, Hello, I'm Shayla. But my friends call me Shay & for a few years now I've been spelling it with an 'E' So I guess I'm Shae, nice to meet you.
<br>
I'm a food craving, selfie taking, YouTube finatic. Who loves all things modern, black & white, simple, artistic, floral & gold.
<br>
My friends describe myself as caring, compassionate, honest & reliable. I see myself as dedicated & having a pride in what I do, 
<br>
I like to take my time with designs & will spend many late nights till I get it right.
<br>
It's hard to summarise yourself in just a paragraph of words, so please feel free to contact me
