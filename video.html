<h2>Time-Based Animation</h2>
<h1>
This project was creating a Time-Based motion graphic that <Br>
went along with the music. My design was inspired by 2D motion <Br>
graphic videos that used a lot of shapes and colour; I added my <Br>
own ink marble art works into my video to make it more visually <Br>
appealing instead of just using solid colour. 
<Br><Br>
I sketched out different transitions in my journal and worked out <Br>
a way to make the shapes work in with the music. The video went a <Br>
little slow at the start so I then started my video at 20 seconds <Br>
in and movedsome of the work I had done further into my video to <Br>
make each second intriguing.

<h2>Chobani</h2>
<h1>
This project was to create a short advert for the yoghurt 'Chobani'<Br>
The ad was to be appealing for bussiness workers on the go. Chobani's <Br>
yoghurts use colours to represent the fruits on the packaging. This is <Br>
were the inspiration for the video came from and why the use of colour <Br>
flows throughout the video.
