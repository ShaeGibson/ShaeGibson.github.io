My design was originally going to be wild animals dressed in circus, <br>
carnival and gang type clothing which was taking into consideration <br>
the slogan 'Born to be wild' This idea felt to original and obvious <br>
so after doing more research, I came across a freelance artist named <br>
Alex Pardee who creates out of the ordinary artworks. 
<br><br>
I was then inspired to use watercolour and flowers in my design after <br>
coming across one of his CD covers. Taking into consideration the theme <br>
of 'Born to be wild' I researched wild flowers and how some people use <br>
gumboots as a vase in their backyards. 
<br><br>
This gave me the idea of a old black and white boot with colourful wild <br>
flowers coming out of it, which was inspired by Alex's artworks where <br>
he uses a black and white figure or object and contrasts it with lots <br>
of colourful things surrounding it. 
<br><br>
After feedback from the class a lot of people said to carry the flowers <br>
around the boot, making it feel more wild I did this and thought it worked <br>
really well as it made the black and white sketched boot stand out more. <br>
One other requirement was a 'splash of pink' So by using a splash of <br>
watercolour in the background it make the boot pop even more.
