For this project I chose an annoying phrase that people say 'That's what she said'<br> 
was my first thought as I say it all the time and people get annoyed at me <br>
for saying it. I thought clothes, lipstick, nail polish, shoes and eyelashes <br>
would be good materials to use as it's talking about 'she' who's obviously a girl.
