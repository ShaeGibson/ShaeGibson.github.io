My first idea to protest against was animal abuse/hunting but after ideas <br>
being similar to other people I decided to go with puppy farms. I researched <br>
other protests that were related and what happens to puppies that suffer in <br>
these farms. I came up with key words such as the puppies not having a voice, <br>
being innocent, living in unhygienic conditions, failing to meet the dogs needs etc. <br>
This led me to the idea of children and how innocent they are. 
<br><br>
What if a child was in a dog cage like the puppies with messy hair, dirty clothes <br>
and a dirty face to show how badly treated the puppies are. The cage was to similar <br>
to someone in class so I thought about using a chain and wrapping it around a pole <br>
in a public space, using a empty dog bowl to show failing the dogs needs and newspaper<br>
 to show unhygienic living conditions. I also brainstormed different slogans to try <br>
 come up with something short, simple and to get my point across. Such as using words <br>
 like why should they suffer, they're defenceless, so are children, both have feelings,<br> 
 whys this frowned upon but the other still goes on? But taking away the 'Whys' because<br> 
 we know why a child being tied to a pole is frowned upon. So my slogan ended up being <br>
 "This is frowned upon but for puppies it still goes on"
